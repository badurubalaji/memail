# Compose Component Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Draft Duplication Problem
**Problem**: Auto-save creates multiple draft copies, and sent emails appear in drafts
**Root Cause**:
- Auto-save creates new drafts every 30 seconds without tracking draft ID properly
- sendEmail doesn't reliably delete draft after sending
- No flag to prevent auto-save during send operation

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `isSendingEmail` flag to prevent auto-save during send
- Improved draft ID tracking in sendEmail()
- Added proper draft deletion after successful send
- Stop auto-save timer before sending

### 2. Quill Editor Toolbar (Gmail-style)
**Problem**: Limited formatting options, doesn't look like Gmail
**Fix Applied**:
- Added font family selector
- Added font size options
- Added text color and background color
- Added alignment options
- Added strike-through
- Added indent/out dent
- Added image and video support
- Better organized toolbar layout

### 3. Quill Editor Styling
**Problem**: Doesn't look like Gmail composer
**Fix Applied**:
- Gmail-style toolbar background (#f5f5f5)
- Better toolbar padding and borders
- Improved editor container styling
- Better min-height for editor
- Smoother scrolling
