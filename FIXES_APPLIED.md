# Fixes Applied - Session Summary

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. Bulk Delete Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Messages deleted from drafts were coming back after deletion

**Root Cause**: The bulk delete method was calling `expunge()` and then `close(false)`, which doesn't guarantee the expunge is committed.

**Fix Applied** (`MailService.java`):
```java
// Changed from:
draftsFolder.expunge();
draftsFolder.close(false);

// To:
draftsFolder.close(true); // true = expunge deleted messages
```

**File Modified**: `backend/src/main/java/com/memail/service/MailService.java` (line 2055-2058)

### 2. Draft Editing - FIXED
**Problem**: Draft messages unable to edit

**Root Cause**: Dialog configuration for editing drafts was different from compose dialog (different size, had backdrop, etc.)

**Fix Applied** (`mail-list.component.ts`):
```typescript
// Changed dialog config to match compose dialog from sidebar
const dialogRef = this.dialog.open(EnhancedComposeComponent, {
  width: '600px',
  height: '600px',
  disableClose: false,
  autoFocus: true,
  hasBackdrop: false,
  panelClass: 'compose-dialog',
  data: {
    mode: 'edit-draft',
    draftData: draftData
  }
});
```

**File Modified**: `frontend/src/app/mail/components/mail-list.component.ts` (lines 753-765)

## ðŸš§ Pending Features (Require More Implementation)

### 3. Email Mention Feature (@email)
**Requirements**:
- When typing @ in compose body, allow adding email ID

**Implementation Needed**:
- Modify `UserManagementService.java` to check domain

## Testing Checklist

### To Test After Restart:
- [ ] Bulk delete all drafts - verify they don't come back
- [ ] Click on a draft email - verify compose dialog opens with draft data
- [ ] Edit draft and save - verify changes persist
- [ ] Edit draft and send - verify sent successfully and draft deleted

### Still Needs Implementation:
- [ ] Email mention feature (@email)
- [ ] Domain-restricted user creation
- [ ] User profile viewing/editing

## Recommendations

For the remaining 3 features, I recommend implementing them in this order:

1. **Domain-restricted user creation** (30 min) - Quick security improvement
2. **User profile enhancement** (4-5 hours) - Important user-facing feature
3. **Email mention feature** (2-3 hours) - Nice-to-have UX improvement

Total estimated time: 6-8 hours for remaining features.
